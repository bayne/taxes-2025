### §1397C. Enterprise zone business defined

### §1398. Rules relating to individuals' title 11 cases

It creates the bankruptcy estate as a separate taxable entity, provides for the computation of its tax using married-filing-separately rates, and governs the transfer of tax attributes (such as NOL carryovers, capital loss carryovers, and credits) between the debtor and the estate. It also allows the debtor to elect to split the taxable year into two short years at the commencement of the bankruptcy case.

### §1400Z-1. Designation

This section establishes the framework for designating qualified opportunity zones. It defines a qualified opportunity zone as a low-income community population census tract nominated by the chief executive of a state and certified by the Secretary of the Treasury. The section specifies criteria for low-income communities based on median family income and poverty rates, limits the number of designations per state, and provides that each designation lasts for 10 years. As amended in 2025, the section provides for new decennial determination periods beginning July 1, 2026.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to personal tax filing because it establishes the geographic framework for the Opportunity Zone program. Individual taxpayers who invest capital gains in qualified opportunity funds (under section 1400Z-2) must know whether the fund invests in designated qualified opportunity zones.

### §1400Z-2. Special rules for capital gains invested in opportunity zones

This section provides the tax incentive rules for capital gains invested in qualified opportunity funds. A taxpayer may elect to defer gain from the sale of property by investing the gain in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days. The deferred gain is included in income upon the earlier of sale of the investment or a specified date (December 31, 2026 under current law, or 5 years after investment under the 2025 amendments for post-2026 investments). Investments held for at least 5 years receive a 10% basis step-up. Investments held for at least 10 years may elect to have their basis equal to fair market value, potentially eliminating tax on appreciation in the opportunity zone investment itself.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is highly relevant to personal tax filing for individuals who have capital gains and choose to invest them in qualified opportunity funds. It affects the timing and amount of capital gains recognition on the individual's return and can provide significant tax deferral and reduction benefits.

### §1401. Rate of tax

This section imposes the self-employment tax on the self-employment income of every individual. It consists of two components: a 12.4% tax for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI), and a 2.9% tax for hospital insurance (Medicare). An additional 0.9% Medicare tax applies to self-employment income exceeding $250,000 for joint filers, $125,000 for married filing separately, or $200,000 for other filers, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. The section also provides relief from these taxes where covered by international social security agreements.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to personal tax filing for anyone with self-employment income. Self-employed individuals must calculate and pay self-employment tax using Schedule SE, and the rates specified in this section determine the amount of that tax.

### §1402. Definitions

This section provides comprehensive definitions for Chapter 2 (Self-Employment Contributions Act), most importantly defining "net earnings from self-employment" and "self-employment income." Net earnings from self-employment is gross income from a trade or business less allowable deductions, plus the individual's distributive share of partnership income, with numerous exclusions for rentals, dividends, interest, capital gains, and certain other items. Self-employment income is net earnings above $400, capped at the Social Security contribution and benefit base for the OASDI portion.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to personal tax filing for any individual with income from self-employment or partnership interests. It determines which types of income are subject to self-employment tax and which are excluded, directly affecting the computation on Schedule SE.

### §1403. Miscellaneous provisions

This section provides that Chapter 2 may be cited as the "Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954" and contains cross references to provisions on returns (section 6017) and collection of taxes in the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico (section 7651).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing. It is a housekeeping provision with cross-references.

### §1411. Imposition of tax

This section imposes the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), a 3.8% tax on the lesser of an individual's net investment income or the excess of modified adjusted gross income over threshold amounts ($250,000 for joint filers, $125,000 for married filing separately, $200,000 for others). Net investment income includes interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, rents, passive activity income, and net gain from disposition of non-business property, reduced by allocable deductions. The tax also applies to estates and trusts. It does not apply to nonresident aliens or distributions from qualified retirement plans.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is highly relevant to personal tax filing for individuals with investment income whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amounts. The NIIT is calculated on Form 8960 and added to the individual's tax liability on Form 1040.

### §1441. Withholding of tax on nonresident aliens

This section requires any person having control, receipt, custody, or payment of income from U.S. sources to a nonresident alien individual or foreign partnership to deduct and withhold tax at a rate of 30% (or 14% for certain scholarship/fellowship income). The income items subject to withholding include interest, dividends, rent, salaries, wages, and other fixed or determinable income. Numerous exceptions apply, including for income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, portfolio interest, certain annuities under qualified plans, and gambling winnings.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to personal tax filing primarily for nonresident aliens who receive U.S.-source income. U.S. persons making payments to nonresident aliens need to comply with these withholding requirements, but the section does not typically affect a U.S. citizen's or resident's own personal return.

### §1442. Withholding of tax on foreign corporations

This section extends the withholding requirements of section 1441 to foreign corporations subject to U.S. taxation, requiring deduction and withholding at the source at a 30% rate on the same items of income applicable to nonresident aliens. It provides exemptions where the Secretary determines the administrative burden is undue, and special rules for possessions corporations.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing. It governs withholding obligations on payments to foreign corporations, which is a matter for the payor (typically a business or financial institution) rather than an individual filer.

### §1443. Foreign tax-exempt organizations

This section applies withholding requirements to income of foreign organizations that are subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income under section 511, and to income of foreign organizations subject to the excise tax under section 4948(a), with withholding at a 4% rate for the latter.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It governs withholding on income of foreign tax-exempt organizations.

### §1444. Withholding on Virgin Islands source income

This section limits the withholding tax on income received from sources within the Virgin Islands by U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and U.S. corporations to the rate of tax actually imposed on such income under section 871(a)(1) or 881.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section has limited relevance to personal tax filing. It may be relevant only to individuals receiving income from Virgin Islands sources who are subject to withholding under the territorial tax system.

### §1445. Withholding of tax on dispositions of United States real property interests

This section requires the transferee in a disposition of a U.S. real property interest by a foreign person to withhold 15% of the amount realized. Several exemptions exist, including when the transferor provides a nonforeign affidavit, when the property is acquired as a residence for $300,000 or less, or when the stock is regularly traded. A reduced 10% withholding rate applies for residences where the amount realized does not exceed $1,000,000. The section also covers withholding on partnership and trust distributions of U.S. real property interests and on distributions by REITs and regulated investment companies.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to personal tax filing for U.S. individuals who purchase real property from foreign persons, as they have withholding obligations. It is also relevant to nonresident aliens selling U.S. real property interests, as the withheld amount can be credited against their U.S. tax liability.

### §1446. Withholding of tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected income

This section requires partnerships with effectively connected taxable income allocable to foreign partners to withhold tax at the highest individual rate for non-corporate foreign partners and the highest corporate rate for corporate foreign partners. It also provides rules for withholding on dispositions of partnership interests where gain would be treated as effectively connected income, requiring a 10% withholding by the transferee. Foreign partners receive a credit for their share of withheld tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to most personal tax filers. It may be relevant to foreign individuals who are partners in U.S. partnerships, as it determines the withholding applied to their share of effectively connected income, which is then credited on their U.S. tax return.

### §1451. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This former section related to tax-free covenant bonds and was repealed in 1984.

This section makes every person required to deduct and withhold tax under Chapter 3 (withholding on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations) liable for such tax and indemnifies them against claims from payees for amounts withheld in accordance with the chapter's provisions.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing. It establishes liability rules for withholding agents, not for individual filers.

### §1462. Withheld tax as credit to recipient of income

This section provides that income subject to withholding at the source under Chapter 3 must be included in the recipient's return, and the amount withheld is credited against the recipient's income tax liability.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to nonresident aliens filing U.S. tax returns who can claim a credit for amounts withheld from their U.S.-source income.

### §1463. Tax paid by recipient of income

This section provides that if a withholding agent fails to deduct and withhold tax but the recipient subsequently pays the underlying tax, the withholding agent is relieved of liability for the withheld amount but not from liability for interest or penalties arising from the failure to withhold.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing. It governs the relationship between withholding agents and the IRS.

### §1464. Refunds and credits with respect to withheld tax

This section provides that where there has been an overpayment of tax under Chapter 3, refunds or credits are made to the withholding agent unless the tax was actually withheld from the payee.

### §1465. Repealed

### §1471. Withholdable payments to foreign financial institutions

This section, part of FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), requires withholding agents to deduct and withhold 30% from withholdable payments made to foreign financial institutions (FFIs) that do not enter into an agreement with the Secretary to report information about U.S. accounts. Compliant FFIs must obtain account holder information, report on U.S. accounts annually, withhold from payments to recalcitrant account holders, and comply with Secretary requests for information. Exceptions exist for payments to foreign governments, international organizations, and foreign central banks.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing for most individuals. However, U.S. persons with accounts at foreign financial institutions may be indirectly affected, as their FFIs must report their account information to the IRS under these rules.

### §1472. Withholdable payments to other foreign entities

This section requires 30% withholding on withholdable payments to non-financial foreign entities unless the entity certifies it has no substantial U.S. owners or provides the names, addresses, and TINs of its substantial U.S. owners. Exceptions apply for publicly traded corporations, their affiliates, entities organized in U.S. possessions, foreign governments, and international organizations.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing. It primarily affects withholding agents and foreign entities receiving U.S.-source payments.

### §1473. Definitions

This section provides key definitions for Chapter 4 (FATCA), including "withholdable payment" (U.S.-source interest, dividends, rents, salaries, and other FDAP income, plus gross proceeds from dispositions of property that can produce such income), "substantial United States owner" (generally persons owning more than 10% of a foreign entity), "specified United States person" (with exclusions for publicly traded corporations, tax-exempt organizations, banks, REITs, and others), "withholding agent," and "foreign entity."

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing, but it defines the terms that determine when U.S. persons are reported on by foreign financial institutions under FATCA, which may trigger reporting obligations or correspondence from the IRS.

### §1474. Special rules

This section establishes liability, credit, and refund rules for Chapter 4 (FATCA) withholding. It makes withholding agents liable for withheld tax, provides rules for credits and refunds (with limitations for foreign financial institutions), requires beneficial owners seeking refunds to provide information about substantial U.S. owners, protects confidentiality of information, and coordinates FATCA withholding with other withholding provisions.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing. It provides administrative rules for FATCA withholding agents.

### §§1491, 1492. Repealed

All member corporations must consent to the consolidated return regulations, and the consolidated return includes each member's income for the portion of the year it belongs to the group.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It applies exclusively to affiliated groups of corporations.

### §1502. Regulations

This section authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations governing consolidated returns by affiliated groups of corporations, covering determination, computation, assessment, collection, and adjustment of tax liability. The Secretary may prescribe rules different from regular Chapter 1 provisions that would apply if corporations filed separately.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It is a regulatory authority provision for corporate consolidated returns.

### §1503. Computation and payment of tax

This section governs the computation and payment of tax for affiliated groups filing consolidated returns. It includes special rules for applying net operating losses of non-insurance members against the income of insurance company members (limited to 35%), rules for dual consolidated losses (which cannot reduce income of other group members), and rules for determining basis adjustments to intragroup stock.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It applies exclusively to consolidated corporate tax returns.

### §1504. Definitions

This section defines "affiliated group" for consolidated return purposes as one or more chains of includible corporations connected through 80% stock ownership (by vote and value) with a common parent. It specifies which corporations are excluded from the definition of "includible corporation," such as tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies taxed under section 801, foreign corporations, regulated investment companies, DISCs, and S corporations. Special rules allow insurance companies to be included under certain elections.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It provides definitions used exclusively for corporate consolidated returns.

### §1505. Cross references

This section provides cross references to the statute of limitations provision (section 6503(a)(1)) and the allocation of income and deductions among related businesses (section 482).

### §1552. Earnings and profits

This section provides methods for allocating the tax liability of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return among the group members for purposes of determining each member's earnings and profits. Four methods are available, including allocation based on each member's share of consolidated taxable income, separate return tax liability, contribution to consolidated income, or any other Secretary-approved method. The default method applies the ratio of each member's taxable income to consolidated taxable income.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It applies exclusively to the determination of earnings and profits of corporate group members in consolidated returns.

### §1561. Limitation on accumulated earnings credit in the case of certain controlled corporations

This section limits component members of a controlled group of corporations to a single $250,000 ($150,000 for certain personal service corporations) accumulated earnings credit under section 535(c)(2) and (3) for their taxable years including the same December 31. The amount is divided equally among the component members unless regulations permit unequal allocation. Special rules apply for short taxable years.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It applies to controlled groups of corporations.

### §1562. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This former section related to elections for multiple surtax exemptions by controlled groups and was repealed in 1969.

### §1563. Definitions and special rules

This section defines "controlled group of corporations" for purposes of the controlled corporation provisions, encompassing parent-subsidiary groups (80% stock ownership chains), brother-sister groups (5 or fewer persons owning more than 50% of multiple corporations), combined groups, and certain insurance company groups. It provides detailed rules for determining component members, excluded members, stock exclusions, constructive ownership rules (including options, partnership/trust/corporate attribution, and family attribution), and operating rules.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing. However, its definitions of controlled groups are referenced by many other provisions throughout the Code that can affect individuals, such as rules for retirement plans and employment taxes.

### §1564. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This former section contained transitional rules for controlled corporations and was repealed in 1990.

### §2001. Imposition and rate of tax

This section imposes the federal estate tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States. The tax is computed by applying the unified transfer tax rate schedule to cumulative lifetime and death-time transfers, then subtracting the gift taxes payable on lifetime transfers. The maximum rate is 40%. The computation also accounts for the unified credit (basic exclusion amount), adjusted taxable gifts, and state death tax credits.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not part of the individual income tax return (Form 1040) but is highly relevant to the personal finances of individuals whose estates may be subject to estate tax. Executors file Form 706 to report the estate tax. The basic exclusion amount affects estate planning decisions during life.

### §2002. Liability for payment

This section provides that the executor of the estate is liable for payment of the estate tax imposed by section 2001.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It establishes who is responsible for paying the estate tax.

### §2010. Unified credit against estate tax

This section provides a credit against the estate tax equal to the applicable credit amount, which is the tentative tax on the basic exclusion amount. The basic exclusion amount is $5,000,000 (adjusted for inflation; increased to $10,000,000 through 2025 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further increased to $15,000,000 through 2028 by subsequent legislation). The section also provides for portability of the deceased spousal unused exclusion amount (DSUE), allowing a surviving spouse to use their deceased spouse's unused exclusion.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not part of Form 1040, but it is extremely relevant to estate and financial planning for individuals. The portability provision requires filing an estate tax return even for non-taxable estates to elect DSUE transfer.

### §2012. Credit for gift tax

This section provides that the estate tax is credited by the amount of gift tax paid on property included in the decedent's gross estate. This prevents double taxation of the same transfer. The credit is limited to the smaller of the gift tax paid or the estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the gifted property.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It applies to estate tax computations on Form 706.

### §2013. Credit for tax on prior transfers

This section allows a credit against the estate tax for estate taxes paid on property transferred to the decedent from a prior transferor who died within 10 years before or 2 years after the decedent's death. The credit decreases by 20% for each two-year interval after the prior decedent's death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It applies to estate tax computations.

### §2014. Credit for foreign death taxes

This section allows a credit against the U.S. estate tax for estate, inheritance, or similar taxes paid to a foreign country on property situated in that country and included in the decedent's U.S. gross estate. The credit is limited to the lesser of the foreign tax attributable to the property or the proportion of the U.S. estate tax attributable to the foreign-situs property.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It applies to estate tax computations for decedents with foreign-situs property.

### §2015. Credit for death taxes on remainders

This section provides a special rule allowing the credit for state death taxes and foreign death taxes on reversionary or remainder interests to be taken at the time the interest comes into possession, if a timely election is made.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It applies to estate tax computations involving remainder interests.

### §2016. Recovery of taxes claimed as credit

This section requires that if any amount of state or foreign death taxes claimed as a credit against the federal estate tax is recovered by the estate, the executor must notify the Secretary and redetermine the estate tax. The additional tax must be paid.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It governs estate tax adjustments.

### §2031. Definition of gross estate

This section defines the gross estate for estate tax purposes as the value at the time of death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated. It includes special rules for property transferred from insurance companies, unlisted stock and securities valuation, and the repeal of special estate tax valuation for real property in a farm or business. The section requires that the value of certain property be included regardless of whether the interest is considered a property right under state law.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It defines the gross estate for estate tax (Form 706) purposes.

### §2032. Alternate valuation

This section permits the executor to elect an alternate valuation date (generally 6 months after the decedent's death) for the gross estate, instead of the date-of-death valuation. This election can only be made if it decreases both the value of the gross estate and the estate tax liability. Property distributed, sold, or otherwise disposed of within the 6-month period is valued as of the date of disposition.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, but the election affects the basis of inherited property that passes to heirs, which in turn affects gain or loss calculations on the heirs' income tax returns.

### §2032A. Valuation of certain farm, etc., real property

This section allows the executor to elect to value certain qualified real property used in farming or a closely held business at its current-use value rather than its fair market value. The reduction from fair market value cannot exceed specified dollar limits (adjusted for inflation). The property must meet requirements for material participation and must pass to qualified heirs. A recapture tax applies if the property ceases to be used in the qualifying manner within 10 years of the decedent's death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, but the special use valuation affects the basis of inherited farm or business property, and the recapture tax may need to be reported if the property is later converted to a different use.

### §2033. Property in which the decedent had an interest

This section includes in the gross estate the value of all property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It is a foundational estate tax provision.

### §2034. Dower or curtesy interests

This section provides that dower, curtesy, or statutory substitute interests are treated as transfers rather than interests held by the surviving spouse, and thus are included in the decedent's gross estate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2035. Adjustments for certain gifts made within 3 years of decedent's death

This section includes in the decedent's gross estate the value of any gift tax paid by the decedent or the decedent's estate on gifts made within 3 years of death ("gross-up" rule). It also requires inclusion of the value of certain interests (life insurance, retained life estates, revocable transfers, and general powers of appointment) transferred within 3 years of death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing but is important for estate tax planning.

### §2036. Transfers with retained life estate

This section includes in the gross estate the value of property transferred during the decedent's life if the decedent retained the right to income, possession, or enjoyment of the property, or the right to designate who shall possess or enjoy the property, for the decedent's life or a period not ascertainable without reference to the decedent's death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It is an estate tax provision affecting estate planning strategies involving retained interests.

### §2037. Transfers taking effect at death

This section includes in the gross estate the value of property transferred during the decedent's life if possession or enjoyment of the property can only be obtained by surviving the decedent, and the decedent retained a reversionary interest exceeding 5% of the value of the property immediately before death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It is an estate tax inclusion provision.

### §2038. Revocable transfers

This section includes in the gross estate the value of property transferred during the decedent's life if, at the date of death, the enjoyment of the property was subject to change through the exercise of a power by the decedent to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate the transfer.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It is an estate tax provision governing revocable transfers, such as revocable trusts.

### §2039. Annuities

This section includes in the gross estate the value of annuities or other payments receivable by any beneficiary by reason of surviving the decedent, to the extent of the portion attributable to contributions made by the decedent. Exceptions exist for certain employer-provided annuities.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing, but it affects the estate tax treatment of survivor annuities, which may indirectly affect beneficiaries.

### §2040. Joint interests

This section provides rules for including jointly held property in the gross estate. Generally, for joint tenancies (other than between spouses), the full value is included except for the portion attributable to the survivor's consideration. For qualified joint interests between spouses, only 50% of the value is included in the estate of the first spouse to die.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing, but it affects the basis of jointly held property received by the survivor, which impacts future capital gains calculations.

### §2041. Powers of appointment

This section includes in the gross estate the value of property over which the decedent possessed a general power of appointment at death, or which the decedent exercised or released during life in a manner that would have triggered inclusion under sections 2035-2038. A general power of appointment is one exercisable in favor of the decedent, the decedent's estate, creditors, or creditors of the estate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It is an estate tax provision.

### §2042. Proceeds of life insurance

This section includes in the gross estate the proceeds of life insurance on the decedent's life receivable by the executor, and proceeds receivable by other beneficiaries if the decedent possessed any incidents of ownership in the policy at death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It determines when life insurance proceeds are included in the taxable estate.

### §2043. Transfers for insufficient consideration

This section provides that if a transfer subject to estate tax inclusion under sections 2035-2038 was made for consideration in money or money's worth, only the excess of the fair market value of the property at the time of death (or alternate valuation date) over the consideration received is included in the gross estate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It is an estate tax provision.

### §2044. Certain property for which marital deduction was previously allowed

This section includes in the gross estate the value of any property for which a marital deduction was previously allowed to the estate of the decedent's spouse under section 2056(b)(7) (qualified terminable interest property, or QTIP). This ensures that the property is eventually taxed in one estate or the other.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It is an estate tax provision related to QTIP trusts.

### §2045. Prior interests

This section provides that sections 2034 through 2042 apply to interests arising before the applicable dates of those sections, and that the provisions do not reduce the estate below what it would have been under prior law.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2046. Disclaimers

This section provides that for estate tax purposes, a qualified disclaimer under section 2518 is treated as if the disclaimed interest had never been transferred to the person making the disclaimer.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing, but disclaimers can affect the distribution of assets and thus indirectly affect the income of beneficiaries.

### §2051. Definition of taxable estate

This section defines the taxable estate as the gross estate minus the deductions allowed by sections 2053 through 2058 (for expenses, losses, charitable transfers, marital deduction, and state death taxes).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It defines the taxable estate for Form 706 purposes.

### §2053. Expenses, indebtedness, and taxes

This section allows deductions from the gross estate for funeral expenses, administration expenses, claims against the estate (including debts of the decedent), and unpaid mortgages and indebtedness on property included in the gross estate. The amounts deductible are limited to those allowable under the laws of the jurisdiction governing the estate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It provides deductions for estate tax purposes.

### §2054. Losses

This section allows a deduction from the gross estate for losses incurred during settlement of the estate arising from fires, storms, shipwrecks, or other casualties, or from theft, to the extent not compensated by insurance.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It provides a deduction for estate tax purposes.

### §2055. Transfers for public, charitable, and religious uses

This section allows a deduction from the gross estate for the value of property transferred to or for the use of the United States, any state, the District of Columbia, charitable organizations, religious organizations, fraternal organizations, and veterans' organizations. Special rules apply for split-interest trusts and the valuation of partial interests.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It provides the charitable deduction for estate tax purposes.

### §2056. Bequests, etc., to surviving spouse

This section provides an unlimited marital deduction from the gross estate for the value of property passing from the decedent to the surviving spouse. Special rules address terminable interests (which generally do not qualify), with important exceptions for qualified terminable interest property (QTIP), life estates with a general power of appointment, and life insurance or annuity payments with a power of appointment.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. However, the marital deduction is a cornerstone of estate planning that affects the financial circumstances of surviving spouses.

### §2056A. Qualified domestic trust

This section provides that the marital deduction is allowed for property passing to a surviving spouse who is not a U.S. citizen only if the property passes to or through a qualified domestic trust (QDOT). The section imposes a tax on distributions of corpus from the QDOT and on the remaining trust property at the surviving spouse's death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing, but the QDOT tax on distributions may have income tax implications for the surviving spouse.

### §2058. State death taxes

This section allows a deduction from the gross estate for the amount of any state or District of Columbia estate or inheritance taxes actually paid, for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2004.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It provides an estate tax deduction for state death taxes paid.

### §2101. Tax imposed

This section imposes the estate tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who was a nonresident not a citizen of the United States. The tax is computed using a modified rate schedule, and the taxable estate includes only property situated within the United States.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing for U.S. citizens or residents. It applies to the estates of nonresident aliens.

### §2102. Credits against tax

This section provides credits against the estate tax for nonresident alien decedents, including a unified credit of $13,000 (or a proportional amount if a treaty applies) and credits for foreign death taxes and tax on prior transfers.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing. It provides estate tax credits for nonresident alien decedents.

### §2105. Property without the United States

This section specifies types of property that are not considered situated within the United States for estate tax purposes, including deposits in U.S. banks, certain portfolio obligations, and property exempt under treaty.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2106. Taxable estate

This section defines the taxable estate of a nonresident noncitizen decedent, allowing deductions for expenses, indebtedness, taxes, losses, charitable transfers, and marital transfers (limited to qualified domestic trusts), proportioned to the U.S.-situs portion of the estate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2107. Expatriation to avoid tax

This section imposes a special estate tax regime on certain individuals who lost U.S. citizenship or ceased to be long-term residents with a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. taxes. For such decedents, the gross estate includes certain property outside the U.S. that was previously owned by the decedent.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing but may be relevant to the estate planning of former U.S. citizens or long-term residents.

### §2108. Application of pre-1967 estate tax provisions

This section provides that the estate tax provisions applicable to nonresident noncitizen decedents as they existed before November 14, 1966 continue to apply in cases where a treaty is in effect that references those provisions.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2201. Combat zone-related deaths of members of the Armed Forces, deaths of astronauts, and deaths of victims of certain terrorist attacks

This section provides estate tax relief for members of the Armed Forces who die in combat zones or from combat-zone-related injuries, astronauts who die in the line of duty, and victims of specified terrorist attacks (including September 11, 2001).

### §2204. Discharge of fiduciary from personal liability

This section provides procedures for the fiduciary (executor) to obtain a written discharge from personal liability for estate and gift taxes by filing a written request with the Secretary and receiving a notification of the amount due or a certificate of discharge.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2205. Reimbursement out of estate

This section provides that if the estate tax is paid by an insurance beneficiary, transferee, or surviving tenant, the executor is authorized to recover the tax from the person(s) whose interest is reduced by the payment.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2206. Liability of life insurance beneficiaries

This section provides that unless the decedent's will directs otherwise, the executor may recover from life insurance beneficiaries a proportionate share of the estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the insurance proceeds in the gross estate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2207. Liability of recipient of property over which decedent had power of appointment

This section provides that the estate of a decedent whose gross estate includes QTIP property (section 2044) or surviving spouse's interest property shall be entitled to recover the estate tax attributable to such property from the recipients, unless the decedent's will provides otherwise.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2207B. Right of recovery where decedent retained interest

This section provides a right of recovery for the estate against recipients of property included in the gross estate by reason of section 2036 (retained life estates), unless the decedent's will specifically directs otherwise.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

This section provides that a decedent who was a citizen of a U.S. possession and became a U.S. citizen solely by virtue of their connection with that possession shall be treated as a U.S. citizen for estate tax purposes only if they were domiciled in the United States at the time of death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2209. Certain residents of possessions considered nonresidents not citizens of the United States

This section provides that a decedent who was a citizen of a U.S. possession and became a U.S. citizen solely by virtue of their connection with the possession, and who was not domiciled in the U.S. at death, shall be treated as a nonresident noncitizen for estate tax purposes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2210. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant.

### §2501. Imposition of tax

This section imposes the federal gift tax on the transfer of property by gift by any individual, whether a citizen, resident, or nonresident. For nonresident noncitizens, the tax applies only to transfers of property situated within the United States. The tax applies whether the transfer is direct or indirect, in trust or otherwise, real or personal, tangible or intangible.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to personal tax filing in that individuals who make gifts exceeding the annual exclusion amount must file a gift tax return (Form 709). While the gift tax is not reported on Form 1040, gift tax liability affects an individual's unified transfer tax credit.

### §2502. Rate of tax

This section provides that the gift tax is computed by applying the unified transfer tax rate schedule (same as the estate tax schedule under section 2001(c)) to cumulative taxable gifts, then subtracting the tax computed on prior period gifts. This creates a progressive tax on the cumulative total of taxable gifts made over the donor's lifetime.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly part of the income tax return, but it determines the gift tax liability reported on Form 709. The gift tax and estate tax share a unified rate schedule.

### §2503. Taxable gifts

This section defines taxable gifts as total gifts made during the calendar year minus the charitable deduction and marital deduction. It provides the annual exclusion ($10,000, as adjusted for inflation) per donee. Transfers for the benefit of a minor under age 21 qualify for the annual exclusion even if the minor's interest is a future interest, as long as certain conditions are met. Transfers for educational or medical expenses paid directly to institutions are not treated as gifts.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who make gifts. The annual exclusion determines which gifts must be reported on Form 709. The exclusions for tuition and medical expenses directly paid to providers are particularly useful for personal tax planning.

### §2504. Taxable gifts for preceding calendar periods

This section provides rules for determining the amount of taxable gifts made in prior calendar periods, taking into account the tax rates and exclusions in effect at the time the gifts were made. This ensures that the progressive rate computation under section 2502 correctly accounts for all prior gifts.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals filing gift tax returns (Form 709), as it governs how prior gifts factor into the current year's gift tax computation.

### §2505. Unified credit against gift tax

This section provides a credit against the gift tax equal to the applicable credit amount (the tentative tax on the basic exclusion amount), reduced by all amounts allowable as credits against the gift tax for preceding calendar periods. This effectively exempts a cumulative total of taxable gifts up to the basic exclusion amount from the gift tax. It is unified with the estate tax credit under section 2010.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals making taxable gifts, as it determines the amount of the unified credit available to offset gift tax on Form 709.

### §2511. Transfers in general

This section provides that the gift tax applies to all transfers of property by gift, whether direct or indirect, and whether in trust or otherwise. It includes special rules for transfers by nonresident noncitizens, limited to property situated within the United States.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section establishes the broad scope of the gift tax, which applies to any individual who transfers property by gift exceeding the annual exclusion.

### §2512. Valuation of gifts

This section provides that if a gift is made in property, the value of the gift is the value of the property at the date of the gift. If property is transferred for less than adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, the excess of the value over the consideration is a gift.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to anyone who makes gifts, as it determines how the value of the gift is computed for Form 709 reporting.

### §2513. Gift by husband or wife to third party

This section allows spouses to elect to treat gifts made by one spouse to a third party as if made one-half by each spouse ("gift splitting"). Both spouses must consent, and the election applies to all gifts made during the calendar year. This effectively doubles the annual exclusion and the applicable credit amount available for gifts by a married couple.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to married individuals who make gifts, as gift splitting requires both spouses to file a gift tax return (Form 709) for the year.

### §2514. Powers of appointment

This section provides that the exercise or release of a general power of appointment is treated as a transfer of property by the holder of the power for gift tax purposes. A general power of appointment is one exercisable in favor of the holder, the holder's estate, creditors, or creditors of the estate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who hold and exercise or release general powers of appointment, potentially triggering gift tax filing requirements.

### §2515. Treatment of generation-skipping transfer tax

This section provides that any generation-skipping transfer tax imposed on an inter vivos direct skip is treated as a taxable gift for purposes of computing the gift tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who make generation-skipping transfers, as it affects the computation of gift tax on Form 709.

### §2516. Certain property settlements

This section provides that transfers of property between spouses incident to a written agreement in settlement of marital or property rights, where divorce occurs within a specified period, are deemed made for adequate and full consideration and thus are not subject to gift tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals going through a divorce who are making property settlements, as it provides gift tax exemption for qualifying transfers.

### §2515A. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant.

### §2517. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant.

### §2518. Disclaimers

This section provides that a qualified disclaimer of an interest in property is treated as if the interest had never been transferred to the disclaiming person. A qualified disclaimer must be irrevocable, in writing, made within 9 months of the transfer, and the disclaiming person must not have accepted the interest or any of its benefits. The disclaimed interest must pass without direction from the disclaiming person to the transferor's spouse or to someone other than the disclaiming person.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who wish to disclaim inherited property, which can affect both gift tax and income tax consequences.

### §2519. Dispositions of certain life estates

This section provides that any disposition of an income interest in a QTIP trust is treated as a transfer of the entire remaining interest in the property for gift tax purposes. This prevents the surviving spouse from divesting the QTIP property without triggering gift tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who are beneficiaries of QTIP trusts and may dispose of their income interest.

### §2521. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant.

### §2522. Charitable and similar gifts

This section provides an unlimited gift tax deduction for gifts to the United States, states, political subdivisions, the District of Columbia, charitable organizations, religious organizations, fraternal organizations, and veterans' organizations. Special rules apply for gifts of partial interests and split-interest trusts (charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, pooled income funds).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who make charitable gifts, as it provides a gift tax deduction that may eliminate or reduce gift tax on such transfers.

### §2523. Gift to spouse

This section provides an unlimited marital deduction for gift tax purposes for gifts between spouses who are U.S. citizens. For gifts to a non-citizen spouse, the annual exclusion is limited to a higher amount ($100,000, adjusted for inflation) rather than the unlimited deduction. Special rules apply for QTIP transfers and joint tenancies.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to married individuals making gifts to their spouses. The unlimited marital deduction eliminates gift tax on interspousal transfers when the recipient is a U.S. citizen.

### §2524. Extent of deductions

This section provides that the charitable and marital deductions are applied against the total gifts made during the calendar year, as adjusted, and the resulting net figure becomes the taxable gifts for the period.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to the computation of gift tax on Form 709.

### §2601. Tax imposed

This section imposes a tax on every generation-skipping transfer (GST) at a flat rate equal to the maximum federal estate tax rate (currently 40%). The tax applies to taxable terminations, taxable distributions, and direct skips.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who make or are involved in generation-skipping transfers. The GST tax is reported on Form 709 (for inter vivos transfers) or Form 706 (for transfers at death).

### §2602. Amount of tax

This section provides that the amount of the generation-skipping transfer tax is the taxable amount multiplied by the applicable rate.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to the computation of GST tax on Forms 706 and 709.

### §2603. Liability for tax

This section specifies who is liable for the GST tax: the transferee in the case of a taxable distribution, the trustee in the case of a taxable termination, and the transferor in the case of a direct skip (except from a trust, where the trustee is liable).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who are transferors in direct skips or beneficiaries of generation-skipping transfers.

### §2604. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant.

### §2611. Generation-skipping transfer defined

This section defines a generation-skipping transfer as a taxable distribution, a taxable termination, or a direct skip. It excludes transfers that are already subject to estate or gift tax on the transfer to a non-skip person, and transfers to the extent the property was already subject to GST tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals involved in generation-skipping transfers, as it determines when the GST tax applies.

### §2612. Taxable termination; taxable distribution; direct skip

This section defines the three types of generation-skipping transfers: a taxable termination (termination of an interest in trust property where all remaining interests are held by skip persons), a taxable distribution (distribution from a trust to a skip person that is not a taxable termination or direct skip), and a direct skip (transfer subject to estate or gift tax to a skip person).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who create trusts or make transfers that may constitute generation-skipping transfers.

### §2613. Skip person and non-skip person defined

This section defines a "skip person" as a natural person assigned to a generation two or more generations below the transferor, or a trust in which all interests are held by skip persons. A "non-skip person" is any person who is not a skip person.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to understanding whether the GST tax applies to a particular transfer or trust arrangement.

### §2621. Taxable amount in case of taxable distribution

This section provides that the taxable amount for a taxable distribution is the value of the property received by the transferee, reduced by any expenses incurred in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of the GST tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section may be relevant to individuals who receive distributions from trusts that are subject to GST tax.

### §2622. Taxable amount in case of taxable termination

This section provides that the taxable amount for a taxable termination is the value of all property with respect to which the taxable termination has occurred, reduced by deductions similar to those allowed under section 2053 for estate tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2623. Taxable amount in case of direct skip

This section provides that the taxable amount for a direct skip is the value of the property received by the transferee.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals making direct skips (gifts or bequests to grandchildren or lower generations).

### §2624. Valuation

This section provides that the value of property for GST tax purposes is its fair market value at the time of the generation-skipping transfer, except that in the case of a taxable termination at the same time as the transferor's death, the alternate valuation and special use valuation elections under sections 2032 and 2032A may apply.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to GST tax computations.

### §2631. GST exemption

This section provides every individual with a GST exemption equal to the basic exclusion amount under section 2010(c) (currently aligned with the estate tax exclusion). The exemption may be allocated to transfers to shelter them from the GST tax. Unused GST exemption may be allocated by the individual or by the executor after death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who make generation-skipping transfers, as the GST exemption is allocated on Form 709 or Form 706.

### §2632. Special rules for allocation of GST exemption

This section provides rules for how the GST exemption is allocated, including automatic allocation for direct skips and indirect skips (transfers to trusts that could have GST tax consequences). It allows individuals to opt out of automatic allocation and provides ordering rules for allocations made at or near death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals filing Form 709 who need to allocate or opt out of allocating their GST exemption.

### §2641. Applicable rate

This section provides that the applicable rate of GST tax for a generation-skipping transfer is the product of the maximum federal estate tax rate (40%) and the inclusion ratio with respect to the transfer.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to the computation of GST tax.

### §2642. Inclusion ratio

This section defines the inclusion ratio as 1 minus the applicable fraction. The applicable fraction is the amount of GST exemption allocated to the trust or transfer divided by the value of the property transferred, reduced by certain deductions and exclusions. The section includes special rules for charitable lead annuity trusts, estate tax inclusion periods, and qualified severances of trusts.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals and estate planners computing the GST tax or making allocation decisions on Form 709.

### §2651. Generation assignment

This section assigns individuals to generations for GST tax purposes. Lineal descendants of the transferor's grandparents are assigned by the number of generations separating them from the transferor. Non-lineal descendants are assigned by birth date relative to the transferor. Spouses are assigned to the same generation as the individual to whom they are married. A special rule reassigns predeceased-parent descendants to a higher generation.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to determining whether a transfer is a generation-skipping transfer.

### §2652. Other definitions

This section defines key terms for the GST tax, including "transferor" (the decedent in the case of property subject to estate tax, or the donor in the case of property subject to gift tax), "trust" (broadly including any arrangement that has substantially the same effect as a trust), and "interest" in a trust.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section provides definitions necessary for computing GST tax.

### §2653. Taxation of multiple skips

This section provides that if there is a generation-skipping transfer of property and immediately after the transfer such property is held in trust, the trust is treated as if the transferor were assigned to the first generation above the highest generation of any person who has an interest in the trust. This "move down" rule prevents cascading GST tax on subsequent generation-skipping transfers from the same trust.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to trustees and beneficiaries of trusts subject to GST tax.

### §2654. Special rules

This section provides special rules for GST tax, including treatment of multiple trusts with substantially separate and independent shares as separate trusts, rules for the inclusion ratio when only a portion of a trust is subject to estate or gift tax, and the basis adjustment for property subject to GST tax at the transferor's death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section may be relevant to individuals receiving property from trusts subject to GST tax, as the basis adjustment rule affects income tax calculations on subsequent dispositions.

### §2661. Administration

This section provides that the GST tax is administered and enforced as if it were imposed by subtitle B (estate and gift taxes), and cross-references the provisions of subtitle F (procedure and administration).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2662. Return requirements

This section requires returns for the GST tax: the transferor files for direct skips (other than from a trust), the trustee files for taxable distributions and taxable terminations, and the executor may file for direct skips at death.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who make generation-skipping transfers and need to understand their filing obligations.

### §2663. Regulations

This section authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the GST tax, including rules for situations where one or more transfers are part of a series.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing.

### §2664. Repealed

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant.

### §2701. Special valuation rules in case of transfers of certain interests in corporations or partnerships

This section provides special valuation rules for gift tax purposes when an individual transfers an interest in a corporation or partnership to a family member while retaining a senior equity interest (such as preferred stock or a preferred partnership interest). Under these rules, retained "applicable retained interests" are generally valued at zero, which increases the deemed gift value, unless the retained interest carries qualified payment rights.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals engaged in family business succession planning, as it governs the gift tax valuation of transfers of interests in family-controlled entities.

### §2702. Special valuation rules in case of transfers of interests in trusts

This section provides special valuation rules for gift tax purposes when an individual transfers an interest in a trust to a family member while retaining an interest. Generally, the retained interest is valued at zero for gift tax purposes, increasing the gift value, unless it is a "qualified interest" such as a qualified annuity interest (GRAT) or qualified unitrust interest (GRUT). Special rules apply to personal residence trusts.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who create GRATs, GRUTs, or qualified personal residence trusts as part of estate planning, as it determines the gift tax value of the transfer.

### §2703. Certain rights and restrictions disregarded

This section provides that for estate, gift, and GST tax purposes, the value of property is determined without regard to any option, agreement, right, or restriction to acquire or use the property at less than fair market value, unless certain requirements are met (the arrangement is a bona fide business arrangement, not a device to transfer property for less than adequate consideration, and comparable to arm's-length transactions).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who are parties to buy-sell agreements or other restrictive arrangements affecting the value of business interests for transfer tax purposes.

### §2704. Treatment of certain lapsing rights and restrictions

This section treats certain lapses of voting or liquidation rights in family-controlled entities as transfers for gift or estate tax purposes if the lapse occurs during the holder's life or at death. It also provides that "applicable restrictions" (restrictions on the ability to liquidate an entity that are more restrictive than state law defaults) are disregarded in valuing transferred interests.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who hold interests in family-controlled entities, as lapses of rights can trigger gift or estate tax consequences.

### §2801. Imposition of tax

This section imposes a tax on U.S. citizens and residents who receive covered gifts or bequests from "covered expatriates" (former U.S. citizens or long-term residents who renounced or abandoned their status). The tax rate is the highest estate or gift tax rate (currently 40%) on the value of the covered gift or bequest. Exemptions apply for gifts or bequests that would qualify for the annual exclusion, marital deduction, or charitable deduction.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to U.S. individuals who receive gifts or inheritances from covered expatriates. The recipient must report and pay the tax, which is distinct from both income tax and estate/gift tax.

### §3101. Rate of tax

This section imposes the employee portion of FICA taxes: a 6.2% old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) tax on wages up to the Social Security wage base, and a 1.45% hospital insurance (Medicare) tax on all wages. An additional 0.9% Medicare tax applies to wages exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 for joint filers).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to personal tax filing. The FICA taxes withheld from wages appear on Form W-2, and the Additional Medicare Tax may require Form 8959. Excess Social Security tax withheld from multiple employers is claimed as a credit on Form 1040.

### §3102. Deduction of tax from wages

This section requires employers to deduct the employee share of FICA taxes from wages at the time of payment. The employer is liable for payment of the tax whether or not it is actually deducted. Special rules apply for tips.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is indirectly relevant to personal tax filing, as it governs the withholding mechanism that produces the FICA tax amounts shown on Form W-2.

### §3111. Rate of tax

This section imposes the employer portion of FICA taxes: 6.2% for OASDI and 1.45% for Medicare on wages paid to employees. It includes numerous statutory notes about credits for qualified sick leave and family leave wages, paid leave credits, and the employee retention credit enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, as it imposes the employer share of FICA taxes. However, individuals who are household employers must pay both the employee and employer shares of FICA tax on Schedule H.

### §3112. Instrumentalities of the United States

This section provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law (except the Federal Reserve Act and the Farm Credit Act), all instrumentalities of the United States shall be subject to FICA taxes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing.

### §3121. Definitions

This section provides comprehensive definitions for FICA purposes, including "wages," "employment," "employee," "employer," and "American employer." It includes extensive lists of excluded services and wages, including agricultural labor, domestic service, services for foreign governments, student services, and many others. The section also defines the contribution and benefit base (Social Security wage base) and provides rules for determining what constitutes employment.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to personal tax filing because it determines what income is subject to FICA taxes and thus affects the amounts withheld as shown on Form W-2, as well as the self-employment tax computation.

### §3122. Federal service

This section provides that remuneration for service performed as an employee of the United States or any instrumentality thereof constitutes wages for FICA purposes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing, though it confirms that federal employees are subject to FICA.

### §3123. Deductions as constructive payments

This section provides that if an employer deducts the employee share of FICA tax from an employee's remuneration, the deduction is equivalent to payment of the remuneration to the employee.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing.

### §3124. Estimate of revenue reduction

This section requires the Secretary to estimate annually the revenue reduction attributable to FICA exclusions for wages paid for domestic service in a private home of the employer.

This section provides that each state or political subdivision that has entered into a Social Security coverage agreement shall make returns and pay the required FICA taxes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing.

### §3127. Exemption for employers and their employees where both are members of religious faiths opposed to participation in Social Security Act programs

This section exempts employers and employees from FICA taxes if both are members of a recognized religious sect that is conscientiously opposed to acceptance of social security benefits and that makes reasonable provision for its dependent members. The exemption requires application and approval.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section may be relevant to individuals who are members of qualifying religious sects, as it exempts them from FICA tax (the income would instead be subject to self-employment tax considerations under section 1402(g)).

### §3128. Short title

This section provides that Chapter 21 may be cited as the "Federal Insurance Contributions Act."

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing.

### §3131. Credit for paid sick leave

This section provides eligible employers with a refundable payroll tax credit for qualified sick leave wages paid to employees, enacted as part of the COVID-19 relief legislation. The credit applies to wages paid during specified periods and is subject to various limits and conditions.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, as it provides a credit to employers. However, self-employed individuals had analogous credits under separate provisions.

### §3132. Payroll credit for paid family leave

This section provides eligible employers with a refundable payroll tax credit for qualified family leave wages paid to employees, enacted as part of the COVID-19 relief legislation. The credit applies to wages paid during specified periods.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, as it provides a credit to employers.

### §3133. Special rule related to tax on employers

This section provides that the credits allowed under sections 3131 and 3132 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the employer's FICA tax liability under section 3111.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing.

### §3134. Employee retention credit for employers subject to closure due to COVID-19

This section provides eligible employers with a refundable payroll tax credit for qualified wages paid during periods of full or partial suspension of operations due to COVID-19 government orders or significant declines in gross receipts. The credit was generally 70% of qualified wages (up to $10,000 per employee per quarter) for 2021.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing. It provides a credit to employers, though wages on which the credit is claimed may affect an employee's W-2 amounts.

### §3201. Rate of tax

This section imposes the employee portion of the Railroad Retirement Tax, consisting of Tier 1 taxes (equivalent to Social Security and Medicare taxes) and Tier 2 taxes (an additional tax unique to railroad employees) on compensation received by railroad employees.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to railroad employees, whose compensation is subject to railroad retirement taxes rather than FICA. The withheld amounts appear on Form W-2 and affect the individual's tax return.

### §3202. Deduction of tax from compensation

This section requires employers to deduct the employee's share of railroad retirement tax from compensation when paid. The employer is liable for payment whether or not the deduction is made.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is indirectly relevant to railroad employees, as it governs withholding of their railroad retirement taxes.

### §3211. Rate of tax

This section imposes the employee representative (self-employed) portion of the Railroad Retirement Tax on every employee representative, consisting of both the employee and employer equivalent Tier 1 taxes and Tier 2 taxes on compensation for services as an employee representative.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to self-employed railroad employee representatives, who must pay both the employee and employer shares of railroad retirement tax.

### §3212. Determination of compensation

This section provides that for purposes of the Railroad Retirement Tax, the compensation of an employee representative is the compensation received during the calendar year.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to most personal tax filers.

### §3221. Rate of tax

This section imposes the employer portion of the Railroad Retirement Tax, consisting of Tier 1 taxes (equivalent to the employer share of Social Security and Medicare taxes), Tier 2 taxes (the additional railroad-specific tax), and supplemental annuity taxes on compensation paid by employers.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, as it imposes taxes on railroad employers.

### §3231. Definitions

This section provides definitions for the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, including "employer," "employee," "employee representative," "compensation," and "company." It defines who constitutes a railroad employer and employee for purposes of the railroad retirement tax system.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to railroad employees and their tax filing, as it determines whether compensation is subject to railroad retirement tax rather than FICA.

### §3232. Court jurisdiction

The rate for employers ranges from 8.2% to 22.1%, and the rate for employees ranges from 0% to 4.9%.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to railroad employees to the extent it affects the Tier 2 tax rate applied to their compensation.

### §3301. Rate of tax

This section imposes the Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) on employers at a rate of 6% on the first $7,000 of wages paid to each employee during the calendar year. Credits are allowed for state unemployment taxes paid, effectively reducing the federal rate to 0.6% for most employers.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, as FUTA is an employer-only tax. However, individuals who are household employers must pay FUTA on Schedule H of Form 1040.

### §3302. Credits against tax

This section provides employers with credits against the FUTA tax for contributions paid to state unemployment funds and for additional credits based on state experience ratings. The section includes rules for successor employers, limits on credits, and special provisions for states with outstanding federal loans.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, though household employers computing FUTA on Schedule H may benefit from these credits.

### §3303. Conditions of additional credit allowance

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing.

### §3401. Definitions

This section provides definitions for income tax withholding purposes, including "wages" (all remuneration for services performed by an employee for an employer, with numerous exceptions), "payroll period," "employee," and "employer." The exceptions from the definition of wages include agricultural labor, domestic service, tips below $20 per month, and many other categories.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to personal tax filing because it determines which payments are subject to income tax withholding, affecting the amounts shown on Form W-2 and the withholding credits on Form 1040.

### §3402. Income tax collected at source

This section is the primary provision governing federal income tax withholding from wages. It requires employers to deduct and withhold income tax from employee wages based on withholding tables or computational procedures prescribed by the Secretary. It provides rules for claiming withholding allowances on Form W-4, voluntary withholding agreements, supplemental wage payments, and withholding on pensions and annuities.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is highly relevant to personal tax filing. It governs the income tax withholding that appears on Form W-2, which is credited against the individual's tax liability on Form 1040. The accuracy of withholding directly affects whether the filer receives a refund or owes additional tax.

### §3403. Liability for tax

This section makes the employer liable for payment of the income tax required to be withheld from wages, and indemnifies the employer against claims for amounts properly withheld.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to personal tax filing for anyone receiving pension, annuity, or retirement plan distributions. The withholding from these payments is reported on Form 1099-R and credited on Form 1040.

### §3406. Backup withholding

This section requires "backup withholding" at a rate of 24% on certain reportable payments (including interest, dividends, and certain other payments) when the payee fails to furnish a correct taxpayer identification number, the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN is incorrect, or there has been a payee certification failure. The withheld amounts are credited against the payee's income tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to personal tax filing. Individuals subject to backup withholding will see the withheld amounts reported on Forms 1099, and these amounts are credited on Form 1040 as tax payments.

### §3501. Collection and payment of taxes

This section provides that the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, 23, and 24 (FICA, railroad retirement, FUTA, and income tax withholding) shall be collected and paid in accordance with the provisions of subtitle F (procedure and administration).

### §3502. Nondeductibility of taxes in computing taxable income

This section provides that FICA and income tax withholding taxes deducted from an employee's wages shall not be allowed as a deduction to the employee in computing taxable income.

### §3503. Erroneous payments

This section provides that no tax refund for overpayment of employment taxes shall be made to any person if such refund would result in a net payment to that person in excess of the tax actually withheld.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax filing.

### §3504. Acts to be performed by agents

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individuals who are real estate agents or direct sellers, as it establishes their status as independent contractors for tax purposes, meaning they must pay self-employment tax and report income on Schedule C.

### §3509. Determination of employer's liability for certain employment taxes

This section provides reduced rates of liability for employers who are assessed employment taxes for workers reclassified as employees (from independent contractors) where the employer did not intentionally disregard reporting requirements. The reduced liability is generally 1.5% of wages for income tax withholding and 20% of the employee share of FICA.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is indirectly relevant to individuals who were misclassified as independent contractors and later reclassified as employees, as the reclassification may affect their FICA tax liability and income tax withholding.

### §3510. Coordination of collection of domestic service employment taxes with collection of income taxes

This section provides that domestic service employment taxes (FICA and FUTA on household employees) are reported and paid on the employer's individual income tax return (Schedule H of Form 1040) rather than on quarterly employment tax returns. The threshold for domestic service is wages of $1,000 or more per calendar quarter (for FUTA) or specified per-worker amounts (for FICA, adjusted for inflation).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to personal tax filing for individuals who employ household workers (nannies, housekeepers, etc.). It governs the Schedule H reporting of household employment taxes on Form 1040.

### §4064. Gas guzzler tax

This section imposes an excise tax on the sale by the manufacturer of automobiles that fail to meet certain fuel economy standards. The tax ranges from $0 for vehicles with fuel economy of at least 22.5 miles per gallon up to $7,700 for vehicles rated below 12.5 miles per gallon. The tax applies to 4-wheeled vehicles manufactured primarily for use on public roads and rated at 6,000 pounds unloaded gross vehicle weight or less, with exceptions for emergency vehicles and nonpassenger automobiles.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Generally not directly relevant to individual tax filers. This is a manufacturer-level excise tax imposed at the point of sale by the manufacturer, not a tax paid directly by individual consumers on their tax returns. However, individuals purchasing new gas-inefficient vehicles may see the economic impact reflected in the vehicle's purchase price.

### §4071. Imposition of tax

This section imposes an excise tax on taxable tires sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer. The tax rate is 9.45 cents (4.725 cents for biasply tires or super single tires) per 10 pounds of maximum rated load capacity exceeding 3,500 pounds.

The tax rates are 18.3 cents per gallon for gasoline, 19.3 cents for aviation gasoline, and 24.3 cents for diesel fuel or kerosene, plus an additional 0.1 cent per gallon for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. Special rates apply for aviation fuel used in commercial aviation. The general rates are scheduled to decrease to 4.3 cents per gallon after September 30, 2028.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant as a line item on individual tax returns. However, this tax is embedded in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel that individuals purchase. Certain individuals may be eligible for credits or refunds of these fuel taxes under sections 6420, 6421, or 6427 (e.g., farmers using gasoline for farming purposes or fuel used for certain nontaxable purposes).

### §4082. Exemptions for diesel fuel and kerosene

This section provides exemptions from the fuel tax imposed by section 4081 for diesel fuel and kerosene that is destined for nontaxable use, indelibly dyed by mechanical injection, and meets certain marking requirements. Nontaxable uses include uses exempt from section 4041(a)(1) tax, use in trains, and certain other specified uses. Additional exceptions to dyeing requirements exist for kerosene used as non-fuel feedstock and for wholesale distributors.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to most individual filers. This section primarily governs fuel distribution and taxation at the wholesale level. However, individuals who purchase dyed (tax-exempt) diesel fuel for off-highway uses such as farming or home heating may benefit from these exemptions indirectly.

### §4083. Definitions; special rule; administrative authority

This section defines key terms for the fuel excise tax provisions, including "taxable fuel" (gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene), "gasoline," "diesel fuel," and "commercial aviation." It also provides that the use of taxable fuel (other than in producing taxable fuels) is considered a removal and therefore subject to tax. The section grants the Secretary administrative authority to inspect fuel storage facilities and records.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to individual tax returns. These are definitional and administrative provisions that support the fuel excise tax system.

### §4084. Cross references

This section provides cross references to other Code provisions that relieve purchasers of gasoline and other taxable fuels from excise tax in certain circumstances, including section 6420 (farm use), section 6421 (certain nonhighway purposes), and section 6427 (nontaxable purposes).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Marginally relevant. The cross-referenced sections (particularly section 6420 for farmers and section 6421 for nonhighway gasoline use) can provide credits or refunds to individual taxpayers who use fuel for qualifying purposes. These are claimed on Form 4136.

### §4101. Registration and bond

This section requires certain persons involved in the production, importation, or distribution of taxable fuels, biodiesel, alcohol, sustainable aviation fuel, and second generation biofuel to register with the Secretary.

### §4103. Certain additional persons liable for tax where willful failure to pay

This section provides that officers, employees, or agents who willfully fail to assure payment of fuel excise taxes, or who willfully cause taxpayers to fail to pay such taxes, shall be jointly and severally liable with the taxpayer for those taxes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This is a penalty and liability provision applicable to persons involved in fuel tax collection, not to individual income tax filers.

### §4104. Information reporting for persons claiming certain tax benefits

This section requires persons claiming tax benefits under sections 34, 40, 40A, 4041(b)(2), 6426, or 6427(e) to file returns providing information about such benefits. The Secretary prescribes the manner and content of such returns to ensure proper administration of fuel-related tax benefits.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Potentially relevant for individuals who claim fuel tax credits (such as the credit for federal tax paid on fuels under section 34), as they may be required to file information returns in connection with those claims.

### §4105. Two-party exchanges

This section provides that in a two-party exchange of taxable fuel between registered persons at a terminal, the delivering person is not liable for the excise tax. Instead, the receiving person (who removes the fuel across the terminal rack) bears the tax liability. The transaction must meet specific requirements including written contract and terminal operator record-keeping.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This governs fuel distribution transactions between registered fuel businesses and has no bearing on individual tax returns.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. These exemptions apply to manufacturers, military purchasers, and dealers, not to individual taxpayers filing personal returns.

### §4216. Definition of price

This section defines how the sales price is determined for purposes of computing manufacturer excise taxes under chapter 32. It addresses the treatment of containers, packing, and transportation charges, and provides constructive sale price rules when articles are sold at retail, on consignment, or between related parties. It also covers partial payments under leases and installment sales, and provides rules for excluding local advertising charges from the taxable sale price.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section governs price determinations for manufacturer excise taxes and does not apply to individual tax returns.

### §4217. Leases

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section governs the treatment of manufacturer leases for excise tax purposes and has no bearing on individual tax returns.

### §4218. Use by manufacturer or importer considered sale

This section provides that if a manufacturer, producer, or importer uses an article (other than certain tires) rather than selling it, the use is treated as a sale and the person is liable for the applicable excise tax. Special rules apply for tires and for coal. The tax is computed based on the price at which similar articles are sold in the ordinary course of trade.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section addresses manufacturer-level excise tax liability and does not affect individual tax returns.

### §4219. Application of tax in case of sales by other than manufacturer or importer

This section provides that if a person acquires from a manufacturer the right to sell an article through a nontaxable transaction or by operation of law, that person's sale of the article is taxable as if made by the manufacturer, and the person is liable for the excise tax.

The tax applies only to amounts paid to persons engaged in the business of transporting property by air for hire. The tax is paid by the person making the payment, with special rules for payments made outside the United States.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to most individuals. This tax applies to commercial air freight shipments and would primarily affect businesses. Individuals shipping packages by air freight would pay this tax indirectly through shipping charges.

### §4272. Definition of taxable transportation, etc.

This section defines "taxable transportation" for air freight tax purposes as air transportation that begins and ends in the United States, with exceptions for certain international and export transportation.

### §4281. Small aircraft on nonestablished lines

This section provides that air transportation excise taxes (sections 4261 and 4271) do not apply to transportation by aircraft with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 6,000 pounds or less, unless the aircraft is operated on an established line or is a jet aircraft. Sightseeing flights are not considered operation on an established line.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Marginally relevant. Individuals using small charter aircraft or sightseeing flights may benefit from this exemption, as the air transportation taxes would not apply to such flights.

### §4282. Transportation by air for other members of affiliated group

This section provides that no air transportation excise tax is imposed when one member of an affiliated group of corporations pays another member for the use of an aircraft owned or leased by a group member, provided the aircraft is not available for hire by non-group members.

The tax is imposed on the employer responsible for contributing to the plan. A 100 percent additional tax applies if the deficiency is not corrected within a taxable period.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to most individuals. This tax applies to employers sponsoring defined benefit pension plans. However, self-employed individuals who sponsor defined benefit plans could potentially be subject to this tax if they fail to make required contributions.

### §4972. Tax on nondeductible contributions to qualified employer plans

This section imposes a 10 percent excise tax on nondeductible contributions to qualified employer plans, section 403(b) plans, and SEPs. Nondeductible contributions are amounts contributed that exceed the deduction limits under section 404. The tax is imposed on the employer.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Potentially relevant. Self-employed individuals who make contributions to their own qualified plans in excess of the deductible limits may be subject to this 10 percent excise tax on the excess contributions.

This section imposes a 6 percent excise tax on excess contributions to IRAs (traditional and Roth), Coverdell education savings accounts, Archer MSAs, health savings accounts, and ABLE accounts. The tax is imposed on the individual account holder for each year the excess contribution remains in the account.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Highly relevant. Individual taxpayers who make excess contributions to any of these accounts are subject to this 6 percent annual tax until the excess is withdrawn.

Prohibited transactions include sales, leases, loans, transfers of plan assets, and provision of services between the plan and a disqualified person.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Highly relevant. Individual IRA owners who engage in prohibited transactions with their IRA (such as borrowing from the IRA, using IRA funds as collateral, or engaging in transactions with disqualified persons) are subject to these excise taxes.

### §4979. Tax on certain excess contributions

This section imposes a 10 percent excise tax on excess contributions and excess aggregate contributions to cash or deferred arrangements (401(k) plans) that are not corrected within 2.5 months after the end of the plan year. The tax is imposed on the employer.

This section imposes an excise tax (the "employer shared responsibility payment") on applicable large employers (generally 50 or more full-time employees) that fail to offer minimum essential coverage to substantially all full-time employees and their dependents, or that offer coverage that is not affordable or does not provide minimum value. The monthly tax is either $2,000 per full-time employee (minus the first 30) or $3,000 per full-time employee receiving a premium tax credit, whichever is less.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to individual tax returns. This tax is imposed on large employers. However, it is related to the individual marketplace -- when employees receive premium tax credits because employer coverage is inadequate, it triggers employer liability.

### §4981. Excise tax on undistributed income of real estate investment trusts

This section imposes a 4 percent excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the distributed amount for a REIT during a calendar year. The required distribution is generally 85 percent of the REIT's ordinary income, 95 percent of capital gain net income, and any undistributed amounts from prior years.

This tax is in addition to regular income tax and applies to the portion of parachute payments that exceeds the individual's base amount (average annualized compensation for the five preceding years). A parachute payment is generally a payment contingent on a change in corporate control that equals or exceeds three times the base amount.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Highly relevant for affected individuals. Corporate executives and other highly compensated individuals who receive golden parachute payments in connection with a corporate change of control are personally liable for this 20 percent excise tax on the excess amount. This is reported on the individual's tax return.

### §5000. Certain group health plans

This section imposes a tax on certain group health plans of large employers (20+ employees) that fail to comply with COBRA secondary payer requirements with respect to end-stage renal disease patients and individuals entitled to Medicare benefits by reason of disability.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This tax is imposed on employer group health plans.

### §5000A. Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage

This section originally required most individuals to maintain minimum essential health coverage or pay a shared responsibility payment (the individual mandate). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced the shared responsibility payment to $0 for months beginning after December 31, 2018, effectively eliminating the penalty while leaving the mandate in place.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Historically relevant but effectively moot for tax years after 2018. While the provision still technically exists in the Code, the penalty for not having health coverage has been reduced to zero at the federal level. Some states have enacted their own individual mandates. For tax years 2014-2018, this was reported on the individual's Form 1040.

### §5000B. Imposition of tax on indoor tanning services

This section imposes a 10 percent excise tax on amounts paid for indoor tanning services (using ultraviolet lamps to tan the skin). The tax is collected by the person providing the service and is paid quarterly. It does not apply to phototherapy services performed by licensed medical professionals.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Indirectly relevant. Individual consumers pay this 10 percent tax when they use indoor tanning services, but it does not require any action on individual tax returns. The tax is collected and remitted by the tanning salon or provider.

This section exempts from transfer and making taxes certain transactions, including transfers to the United States, making by or on behalf of the United States, making by qualified manufacturers, transfers between special taxpayers, and transfers of unserviceable firearms as curios. All exempt transfers or makings require an application.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section provides exemptions from firearms excise taxes.

### §5853. Transfer and making tax exemption available to certain governmental entities

This section exempts from transfer and making taxes the transfer of firearms to, or the making of firearms by or on behalf of, any state, possession, political subdivision, or official police organization engaged in criminal investigations. Exemption requires an application.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section provides governmental exemptions from firearms excise taxes.

### §5854. Exportation of firearms exempt from transfer tax

This section exempts firearms exported from the United States from the transfer tax under section 5811, provided proof of exportation is furnished as prescribed by the Secretary.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section exempts exported firearms from the transfer tax.

### §5861. Prohibited acts

This section enumerates prohibited acts under the National Firearms Act, including engaging in the firearms business without paying occupational tax or registering, receiving or possessing unregistered or illegally made firearms, transferring or making firearms in violation of the chapter, obliterating serial numbers, transporting unregistered firearms in interstate commerce, importing firearms illegally, and making false entries on required documents.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section lists prohibited acts under the National Firearms Act.

### §5871. Penalties

This section provides that any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of the National Firearms Act shall be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned up to 10 years, or both.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section establishes criminal penalties for National Firearms Act violations.

### §5872. Forfeitures

This section provides that any firearm involved in a violation of the National Firearms Act is subject to seizure and forfeiture. Forfeited firearms cannot be sold at public sale; they must be destroyed, transferred to government agencies, or sold to states or political subdivisions as directed by the Administrator of General Services.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This section concerns forfeiture of firearms under the National Firearms Act.

### §5881. Greenmail

This section imposes a 50 percent excise tax on any person who receives "greenmail" -- consideration transferred by a corporation to acquire its stock from a shareholder who held the stock less than 2 years and who made or threatened a public tender offer. The tax applies whether or not the gain is recognized. The tax does not apply to acquisitions made on the same terms to all shareholders.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Potentially relevant in rare circumstances. If an individual receives greenmail (a corporate buyback of stock held short-term after making or threatening a tender offer), the 50 percent excise tax on the gain is treated like a subtitle A tax for deficiency purposes. However, this situation is extremely rare and would not apply to typical personal tax filers.

### §5891. Structured settlement factoring transactions

This section imposes a 40 percent excise tax on any person who acquires structured settlement payment rights in a factoring transaction. The tax does not apply if the transfer is approved in advance by a qualified court order finding the transfer does not contravene law and is in the best interest of the payee. The section defines key terms including "structured settlement," "factoring discount," and "applicable State statute," and provides that the tax does not affect the tax treatment of the underlying structured settlement.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Potentially relevant in unusual circumstances. If an individual acquires structured settlement payment rights (e.g., buys the right to receive someone else's periodic settlement payments at a discount), this 40 percent tax could apply unless the transaction is court-approved. For most individuals, this section would not come into play during personal tax filing.

### §6001. Notice or regulations requiring records, statements, and special returns

This section grants the Secretary broad authority to require any person liable for any tax under this title to keep records, render statements, and make returns. It also limits the records employers must keep for charged tips to charge receipts, records necessary to comply with section 6053(c), and copies of employee statements.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant. This section is the foundational authority requiring all taxpayers, including individuals, to keep records sufficient to support their tax returns. Individuals filing personal income tax returns should maintain records of income, deductions, and credits as required by the Secretary.

### §6011. General requirement of return, statement, or list

This section establishes the general requirement that any person liable for tax under this title must make a return or statement according to prescribed forms and regulations. It addresses electronic filing requirements (including thresholds for mandatory e-filing), special rules for tax return preparers, promotion of electronic filing, and disclosure of prohibited tax shelter transactions to tax-exempt entities.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Directly relevant. This is the foundational section requiring taxpayers to file returns. It affects individual filers through its e-filing rules (specified tax return preparers must file individual returns electronically) and its general requirement that prescribed information be included on returns.

### §6012. Persons required to make returns of income

This section specifies which persons are required to file income tax returns, including individuals whose gross income equals or exceeds the standard deduction (for 2018-2025), corporations, estates with $600 or more of gross income, trusts with any taxable income or $600 or more of gross income, political organizations, homeowners associations, and bankruptcy estates. Returns of decedents must be filed by executors, and returns of disabled persons by authorized agents or guardians.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Directly relevant. This is one of the most important sections for personal tax filing as it determines whether an individual is required to file a federal income tax return. For taxable years 2018 through 2025, the filing threshold is based on whether gross income exceeds the applicable standard deduction. It also addresses filing requirements for married persons and special rules for surviving spouses.

### §6013. Joint returns of income tax by husband and wife

This section authorizes married couples to file a single joint return of income taxes, even if one spouse has no income or deductions. It establishes exceptions (no joint return if either spouse is a nonresident alien or if they have different taxable years), rules for filing joint returns after the death of a spouse, procedures for switching from a separate to a joint return, and provisions for treating a nonresident alien spouse as a U.S. resident for tax purposes. Joint and several liability applies to joint returns.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Directly relevant. This section is fundamental to married taxpayers, as it governs whether and how spouses may file jointly, the rules for joint and several liability, and special elections for spouses of nonresident aliens. Understanding this section is essential for married individuals deciding their filing status.

### §6014. Income tax return -- tax not computed by taxpayer

This section allows certain individuals who do not itemize deductions, have gross income less than $10,000 consisting primarily of wages, dividends, and interest (with non-wage income not exceeding $100), to elect not to compute their own tax. The Secretary computes the tax and mails the taxpayer a notice of the amount payable.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Somewhat relevant. While this provision remains in the Code, its practical utility is limited in modern practice where most taxpayers (or their software) compute their own tax. It applies to a narrow group of low-income taxpayers with very simple returns.

### §6015. Relief from joint and several liability on joint return

This section provides three forms of relief from joint and several liability for individuals who filed joint returns: innocent spouse relief (subsection (b)) where the understatement was attributable to the other spouse and the filer had no knowledge of it; separation of liability (subsection (c)) for individuals who are no longer married to or living with the other filer; and equitable relief (subsection (f)) as a catch-all when the other forms of relief are unavailable but it would be inequitable to hold the individual liable. The section includes detailed procedures for Tax Court review and allocation of deficiencies.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Highly relevant for individuals who filed joint returns and face tax liability attributable to their spouse's errors or omissions. This section provides critical protections for innocent spouses and is frequently invoked in domestic situations involving divorce, separation, or financial abuse. Any individual seeking relief from joint return liability should be aware of these provisions.

### §6017. Self-employment tax returns

This section requires every individual (other than a nonresident alien) with net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more for the taxable year to file a return for self-employment tax under chapter 2. For married couples filing jointly, the self-employment tax is computed on each spouse's separate self-employment income.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Directly relevant. Any individual with net self-employment income of $400 or more must file a return reporting self-employment tax (Schedule SE). This applies to freelancers, independent contractors, sole proprietors, and others who earn income outside of traditional employment.

### [§6016. Repealed]

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This repealed section formerly required corporations to file declarations of estimated income tax.

### [§6017A. Repealed]

This section has been repealed and is no longer in effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant. This repealed section formerly related to place of residence.

### §6018. Estate tax returns

This section requires the executor to file an estate tax return when the gross estate of a U.S. citizen or resident exceeds the basic exclusion amount in effect under section 2010(c), or when the gross estate of a nonresident non-citizen situated in the United States exceeds $60,000. These amounts are reduced by certain adjusted taxable gifts made after 1976. Beneficiaries must also file returns for parts of the gross estate the executor cannot fully report.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant in limited circumstances. While this section primarily concerns estate tax filing by executors, individuals serving as executors or administrators of decedents' estates need to know when an estate tax return (Form 706) is required. For most individuals, however, the basic exclusion amount (currently over $13 million) means no estate tax return filing obligation.

### §6019. Gift tax returns

This section requires any individual who makes taxable gifts during a calendar year to file a gift tax return, excluding transfers covered by the annual exclusion (section 2503(b) or (e)), transfers qualifying for the marital deduction (section 2523), and certain transfers of entire interests qualifying for the charitable deduction (section 2522).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant for individuals who make significant gifts. Any individual who makes gifts exceeding the annual exclusion amount (currently $18,000 per recipient in 2024) or who makes certain other transfers must file a gift tax return (Form 709). This is separate from the income tax return but is an important filing obligation for individuals who make substantial gifts.

### §6020. Returns prepared for or executed by Secretary

This section authorizes the Secretary to prepare returns for persons who fail to file required returns, based on available information. It also allows the Secretary to execute returns for persons who consent to disclose information but are unable to make the return themselves.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant. If an individual fails to file a required income tax return, the IRS may prepare a substitute return under this section, which can lead to assessment and collection of tax. Understanding this provision motivates timely filing.

### §6021. Listing by Secretary of taxable objects owned by nonresidents of internal revenue districts

This section authorizes the Secretary to list and assess taxable objects owned by nonresidents of the internal revenue district where such objects are located, when such persons fail to file required returns.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not relevant to most personal filers. This section has limited modern application and primarily concerns the Secretary's administrative authority.

### §6031. Return of partnership income

This section requires every partnership to file a return for each taxable year stating items of gross income and deductions, the names and addresses of partners, and each partner's distributive share. It includes special rules for electing large partnerships and partnerships with foreign partners. The return is filed for informational purposes as partnerships do not pay income tax directly.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant for individuals who are partners in partnerships. While the partnership files the information return (Form 1065), each partner receives a Schedule K-1 reporting their share of partnership income, deductions, and credits, which must be included on their personal income tax return.

### §6032. Returns of banks with respect to common trust funds

This section requires banks maintaining common trust funds to file returns regarding the fund's taxable income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits for each taxable year.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to most individual filers. However, individuals who participate in common trust funds managed by banks may receive information needed for their personal returns based on information reported under this section.

### §6033. Returns by exempt organizations

This section requires most tax-exempt organizations to file annual information returns with the Secretary, including gross income, receipts, disbursements, and other prescribed information. Exceptions exist for certain organizations including churches, government entities, and organizations with gross receipts below specified thresholds. Special electronic filing requirements apply to certain organizations.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to personal income tax filing, as this section concerns returns filed by exempt organizations. However, the information reported by exempt organizations can affect individuals (e.g., charitable contribution substantiation, compensation reporting).

### §6034. Returns by certain trusts

This section requires trusts described in section 4947(a)(2) (split-interest trusts) and trusts claiming charitable or similar deductions under section 642(c) to file information returns as prescribed by the Secretary, with exceptions for trusts where all unexpired interests are devoted to specified purposes or which are fully tax-exempt.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Not directly relevant to most individual filers. This section concerns trust-level information reporting, though beneficiaries of such trusts would receive information affecting their personal returns.

### §6034A. Information to beneficiaries of estates and trusts

This section requires fiduciaries of estates and trusts to furnish each beneficiary with a statement containing the beneficiary's share of items of income, deductions, credits, and other information necessary for the beneficiary to prepare their personal tax return.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant for individuals who are beneficiaries of estates or trusts. Beneficiaries use the information reported under this section (typically Schedule K-1 from Form 1041) to report their share of estate or trust income on their personal income tax returns.

### §6035. Basis information to persons acquiring property from decedent

This section requires executors of estates required to file estate tax returns (and certain other persons) to furnish each person acquiring property from a decedent with a statement identifying the property and its final value as reported for estate tax purposes. This information establishes the recipient's basis in the inherited property.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant for individuals who inherit property from an estate that is required to file an estate tax return. The basis information provided under this section is necessary for computing gain or loss when the inherited property is later sold or disposed of, which is reported on the individual's income tax return.

### §6036. Notice of qualification as executor or receiver

This section requires executors, receivers, and similar fiduciaries to give notice of their qualification to the Secretary in the manner and at the time prescribed by regulations.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Somewhat relevant. Individuals who become executors or receivers must comply with this notification requirement, but it does not directly affect the filing of personal income tax returns.

### §6037. Return of S corporation

This section requires every S corporation to file a return stating items of gross income, deductions, and each shareholder's pro rata share, along with names, addresses, and stock ownership information. Shareholders' consent to S corporation elections may be made through the return.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant for individuals who are S corporation shareholders. While the S corporation files the information return (Form 1120-S), each shareholder receives a Schedule K-1 reporting their pro rata share of income, deductions, credits, and other items that must be included on their personal income tax return.

### §6038. Information reporting with respect to certain foreign corporations and partnerships

This section requires U.S. persons who control certain foreign corporations or are officers/directors of foreign corporations in which a U.S. person acquires a 10 percent or greater interest to furnish information about the foreign entity, including financial statements, transactions, and substantial shareholder information. Substantial penalties apply for failure to comply.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** Relevant for individuals who have ownership interests in or control over foreign corporations or partnerships.

### §6038A. Information with respect to certain foreign-owned corporations

It includes record maintenance requirements and penalties for noncompliance. This applies broadly to reportable transactions between the domestic corporation and its foreign related parties.

### §6038B. Notice of certain transfers to foreign persons

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to personal tax filing as it provides the basis for rounding dollar amounts on tax returns.

### §7505. Sale of personal property acquired by the United States

This section authorizes the Secretary to sell personal property acquired by the United States in payment of or as security for debts arising under the internal revenue laws, with proceeds paid into the Treasury as internal revenue collections.

The benefits extend to the servicemember's spouse.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is highly relevant to military personnel and their spouses who file personal tax returns. It provides automatic extensions of virtually all tax filing and payment deadlines for those serving in combat zones or contingency operations, and is one of the most important tax relief provisions for military families.

### §7508A. Authority to postpone certain deadlines by reason of Federally declared disaster, significant fire, or terroristic or military actions

This section authorizes the Secretary to postpone tax deadlines for up to one year for taxpayers affected by federally declared disasters, significant fires, or terroristic/military actions. It includes special rules for pension plans, state-declared disasters, and a mandatory 120-day extension for qualified taxpayers in disaster areas. Qualified taxpayers include those whose principal residence or business is in the disaster area, relief workers, and their spouses.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers who receive IRS notices. It ensures that notices contain enough information for taxpayers to understand why they owe additional tax, which aids in responding to or disputing such notices.

### §7523. Graphic presentation of major categories of Federal outlays and income

This section requires the Secretary to include in Form 1040 instruction booklets pie-shaped graphs showing the relative sizes of major federal outlay categories (defense, Social Security, etc.) and major income categories (personal income taxes, corporate taxes, borrowing, etc.).

The section included an online portal for opting out and modifying payment amounts, and applied only to the period from July 1 through December 31, 2021.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section was directly relevant to individual taxpayers for the 2021 tax year.

### §7528. Internal Revenue Service user fees

This section requires the Secretary to establish a user fee program for IRS ruling letters, opinion letters, determination letters, and similar requests. Fees vary by category, are payable in advance, and the Secretary provides exemptions for certain small pension plan determination requests.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is highly relevant to individual taxpayers. Identity theft affecting tax returns is a significant problem, and this section ensures that individuals are notified when the IRS suspects their identity has been misused. It directly affects personal tax filing by providing identity protection measures like IP PINs.

### §7530. Application of earned income tax credit to possessions of the United States

This section provides for federal matching payments to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa to support their earned income tax credit programs. Puerto Rico receives a specified matching amount based on its EITC costs, while mirror code possessions receive full cost reimbursement. The section includes requirements for Puerto Rico and American Samoa to reform or enact earned income tax credits.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to most individual taxpayers filing U.S. federal returns. It is relevant to residents of U.S. possessions who may benefit from locally administered earned income tax credits funded through these federal transfers.

### §7601. Canvass of districts for taxable persons and objects

This section directs the Secretary to cause Treasury officers or employees to canvass each internal revenue district to identify persons who may be liable for internal revenue taxes and objects subject to tax.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to the preparation of a personal tax return. It describes the IRS's general authority to identify taxable persons and objects.

This section authorizes the Secretary to examine books, papers, records, and other data; summon persons to appear and testify under oath; and take testimony for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of returns, making returns where none were filed, determining tax liability, or collecting tax. It also authorizes inquiries into tax offenses, requires notice of third-party contacts, prohibits administrative summonses when a Justice Department referral is in effect, and limits use of financial status techniques to cases where unreported income is indicated.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers because it defines the IRS's authority to audit personal tax returns, examine records, and summon testimony. Understanding these powers helps taxpayers know their rights and obligations during an audit.

### §7603. Service of summons

This section provides rules for serving IRS summonses, including delivery of an attested copy in hand or at the person's last place of abode. For third-party recordkeepers (banks, brokers, attorneys, accountants, etc.), summonses may also be served by certified or registered mail.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to tax return preparation but affects individual taxpayers who receive IRS summonses or whose records are summoned from third parties during an audit.

### §7605. Time and place of examination

This section provides that the time and place of IRS examinations must be reasonable under the circumstances, with at least 10 days' notice for summons appearances.

Notably, it establishes the IRS Whistleblower Program, providing awards of 15-30% of collected proceeds to individuals who provide information leading to IRS action against taxpayers with gross income exceeding $200,000 and disputes exceeding $2,000,000. It also includes anti-retaliation protections for whistleblower employees.

### §7653. Shipments from the United States

This section imposes taxes on U.S.-manufactured articles shipped to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands equal to the internal revenue taxes imposed in those territories. Articles shipped from the U.S. to possessions are exempt from U.S. internal revenue taxes, and drawback provisions apply to articles previously taxed that are shipped to possessions.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It governs taxation of goods shipped from the U.S. to its possessions.

### §7654. Coordination of United States and certain possession individual income taxes

This section provides that net income tax collections with respect to individuals who are bona fide residents of specified possessions (Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and Virgin Islands) under sections 931 or 932(c) shall be covered into the treasury of that possession. It includes rules for transfers, payments related to armed forces members stationed in possessions, and federal employees in possessions.

### §7701. Definitions

This is one of the most comprehensive definition sections in the Internal Revenue Code. It defines dozens of fundamental terms used throughout the tax code, including "person," "partnership," "corporation," "domestic," "foreign," "fiduciary," "United States," "State," "Secretary," "taxpayer," "taxable year," "trade or business," "United States person," "foreign estate or trust," "tax return preparer," "individual retirement plan," "joint return," "TIN," and many others. It also includes extensive provisions defining "prohibited foreign entity" and "material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity" for purposes of clean energy tax credits.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is highly relevant to personal tax filing. Many of the terms defined here -- such as "taxable year," "joint return," "individual retirement plan," "taxpayer," and "United States person" -- are fundamental to understanding how the tax code applies to individual filers. The definitions in this section are foundational to interpreting virtually every provision of the tax code that affects personal returns.

### §7702. Life insurance contract defined

This section defines a "life insurance contract" for tax purposes using a cash value accumulation test or a guideline premium test combined with a cash value corridor requirement. It establishes computational rules including interest rate assumptions, mortality charge requirements, and special provisions for flexible premium contracts. Contracts that fail these tests are not treated as life insurance for tax purposes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers who own life insurance policies. Whether a contract qualifies as life insurance under this section determines the tax treatment of death benefits (generally tax-free under section 101), cash value accumulation (generally tax-deferred), and policy loans, all of which affect personal tax returns.

### §7702A. Modified endowment contract defined

This section defines a "modified endowment contract" (MEC) as a life insurance contract that fails a "7-pay test" -- meaning premiums paid during the first 7 years exceed the sum that would be needed to pay up the contract in 7 level annual payments. Material changes to a contract can trigger retesting. MECs are subject to less favorable tax treatment on distributions and loans.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers who own life insurance policies. If a policy is classified as a MEC, distributions and loans from the policy are taxed on an income-first basis (rather than return of premium first), and a 10% additional tax may apply on pre-age-59-1/2 distributions, which must be reported on the individual's tax return.

### §7702B. Treatment of qualified long-term care insurance

This section defines "qualified long-term care insurance" and provides that it is generally treated as accident and health insurance for tax purposes. It establishes requirements for qualifying contracts, including coverage of qualified long-term care services, consumer protection provisions, and per diem limitations. Benefits received under qualified contracts are generally excludable from income up to specified limits.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers who pay premiums for or receive benefits from long-term care insurance. Premiums for qualified policies may be deductible as medical expenses (subject to AGI limitations), and benefits received are generally excludable from income, both of which affect personal tax returns.

### §7703. Determination of marital status

This section provides rules for determining marital status for tax purposes. Marital status is generally determined as of the close of the taxable year. A legally separated individual under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance is not considered married. An individual living apart from their spouse for the last 6 months of the year who maintains a household for a dependent child and pays over half the household costs may be considered unmarried for head of household purposes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is directly relevant to individual taxpayers. It determines whether a taxpayer files as single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or head of household, which is one of the most fundamental choices in preparing a personal tax return, affecting tax rates, standard deduction amounts, and eligibility for various credits and deductions.

### §7704. Certain publicly traded partnerships treated as corporations

This section provides that publicly traded partnerships (those with interests traded on an established securities market or readily tradable on a secondary market) are generally treated as corporations for tax purposes. An exception applies if 90% or more of the partnership's gross income consists of qualifying income (interest, dividends, real property rents, gains from real property or natural resource activities, etc.).

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers who invest in publicly traded partnerships (PTPs). If a PTP is treated as a corporation under this section, distributions are treated as dividends rather than partnership distributions, which affects how the income is reported on the individual's tax return.

### §7705. Certified professional employer organizations

This section establishes the certification process for professional employer organizations (PEOs) that act as employers for employment tax purposes. It defines requirements for certification, including financial responsibility, bonding, audit requirements, and reporting obligations. Certified PEOs are treated as employers of covered employees for employment tax purposes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax return preparation. It primarily affects businesses that use PEOs for employment tax administration, though employees of companies that use certified PEOs are affected indirectly through proper employment tax withholding.

### §7801. Authority of Department of the Treasury

This section grants the Department of the Treasury authority over administration and enforcement of the internal revenue laws. It establishes the role of the Secretary of the Treasury and provides for delegation of authority. It includes provisions regarding IRS employees' contacts with congressional offices and maintaining a balanced budget impact analysis for legislation.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It governs the organizational authority of the Treasury Department and IRS.

### §7802. Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board

This section establishes the IRS Oversight Board, consisting of nine members (six private-life members appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and a full-time federal employee representative). The Board oversees IRS administration, reviews strategic plans, and approves the IRS budget, but does not intervene in specific taxpayer cases.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax return preparation. It governs the oversight structure of the IRS.

### §7803. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; other officials

This section provides for the appointment of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the President with Senate confirmation for a 5-year term. It establishes the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate (headed by the National Taxpayer Advocate), the IRS Independent Office of Appeals, and provides for Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration oversight. The National Taxpayer Advocate must submit annual reports to Congress identifying the most serious problems encountered by taxpayers.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers because it establishes the Taxpayer Advocate Service, which assists taxpayers experiencing significant hardship, and the Independent Office of Appeals, which provides an independent review of IRS determinations before taxpayers must go to court. Both are important resources for individual filers with tax disputes.

### §7804. Other personnel

This section authorizes the Commissioner to employ persons for enforcement of internal revenue laws and authorizes the Secretary to designate personnel to administer real estate. It includes special provisions regarding taxpayer service employees and requires that IRS employees be given adequate customer service training.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not directly relevant to personal tax return preparation, though it indirectly affects taxpayers by governing the staffing and training of IRS employees who assist individual filers.

### §7805. Rules and regulations

This section authorizes the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations for enforcement of the tax code, and provides that retroactive regulations may not apply to the period before their filing with the Federal Register. Temporary regulations must also be issued as proposed regulations and expire within 3 years. It includes a cross reference to the Administrative Procedure Act.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is indirectly relevant to individual taxpayers. The regulations issued under this authority interpret and implement the tax code provisions that govern personal tax filing, and the limitation on retroactive regulations protects taxpayers from being held to standards that did not exist when they filed their returns.

### §7806. Construction of title

This section provides rules for interpreting the Internal Revenue Code, stating that cross references, descriptive matter in section and subsection headings, and table of contents entries shall not be given legal effect.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing.

### §7807. Rules in effect upon enactment of this title

This section provides that existing rules, regulations, and Treasury decisions under prior internal revenue laws remain in effect to the extent not inconsistent with the current code, until superseded.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing.

### §7808. Depositaries for collections

This section authorizes the Secretary to designate depositaries for receiving federal tax collections.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing, though it supports the banking infrastructure through which individual tax payments are processed.

### §7809. Deposit of collections

This section provides rules for depositing tax collections into the Treasury, maintaining a deposit fund for estimated income tax refunds, and accounting for collections. It includes special rules for amounts received from undercover operations.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing.

### §7810. Revolving fund for redemption of real property

This section establishes a revolving fund to finance the redemption by the United States of real property to which the United States is entitled by reason of liens for unpaid taxes.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing.

### §7811. Taxpayer Assistance Orders

This section authorizes the National Taxpayer Advocate to issue Taxpayer Assistance Orders (TAOs) requiring the IRS to release a levy, cease action, or take other specific actions when a taxpayer is suffering or about to suffer a significant hardship as a result of IRS administration. TAOs may be modified or rescinded only by the Taxpayer Advocate, the Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is relevant to individual taxpayers experiencing significant hardship due to IRS actions. While it does not affect the preparation of a tax return, it provides an important avenue of relief for individuals facing collection actions, levies, or other IRS actions that cause undue hardship.

### §7812. Streamlined critical pay authority for information technology positions

This section authorizes the Commissioner to appoint IT professionals at higher pay rates (up to the Vice President's salary) to meet critical hiring needs, outside the normal civil service pay structure, for up to 200 positions.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing. It governs IRS IT staffing.

### §7851. Applicability of revenue laws

This section addresses the transition between the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the 1954/1986 Code, specifying which provisions of each apply to various taxes and time periods. It provides that references in the current code to prior code provisions shall be deemed references to the corresponding current provisions.

**Relevance to personal tax filing:** This section is not relevant to personal tax filing for current tax years. It is a transitional provision.

### §7852. Other applicable rules

This section provides that the Internal Revenue Code does not preclude common law or statutory rights unless explicitly stated. It includes rules about prior offenses, gender-neutral construction, and the relationship between the tax code and other federal laws, particularly regarding tribal governmental authority.
